## Introduction & Using This Guide

I made this guide to easily see the status of various tools for the new Apple Silicon Macs. I intend this to be a living document, that gets updated as things change.

The goal is to explain the best way to install or use these tools and which tools you can trust.

At the start of each section I have made a list of each tool within that group. 

✅ Runs on Apple Silicon  
⚠️ Runs on Apple Silicon __with Caveats__  
☑️ Runs on Rosetta  
🚫 Does not Run  

## My Mac

As soon as I had finished listening to Apple's announcement event for their new Apple Silicon Macs, I immediately went to the Apple online store and continued to refresh the page until it would let me buy. I bought a base-level 13" Macbook Pro (M1 chip, 8Gb RAM, and 256Gb SSD).

I was very excited about the potential speed increases that I could get from a small development laptop. Most of all, I love that it runs 100% silent.

Overall this computer has been incredible.

## Shell

✅ Bash  
✅ Zsh  
✅ Oh-my-zsh

### Bash

Comes pre-installed and runs natively under Apple Silicon. It is **NOT** the default shell, but you can switch to it easily. 

It is installed under `/usr/bin/bash`

### Zsh

All Apple Silicon macs have Zsh pre-installed and configured as the default shell. It runs natively under Apple Silicon.

Boot up the terminal and you're using it.

### Oh-my-zsh

Runs as an extension of the Zsh shell. So it natively Apple Silicon compatible.

You will need to install this with a simple git clone command and running install shell script.

## Languages

✅ Python  
✅ PHP  
✅ Go

## Package Managers

⚠️ Homebrew  
✅ Composer (PHP)  
✅ NPM (JS)  
✅ Yarn (JS)  

## Databases

✅ MySQL   
✅ Redis

## Docker

Docker does so much that I didn't really know how to categorize it other than making it a category in and of itself.

In addition, Docker is one of the most confusing applications for Apple Silicon macs. Apple started by showing it off during the announcement keynote event. Unfortunately no one actually told the Docker company about this, so they were pretty shocked to see it working. Once Apple Silicon macs became available, it turns out that it wasn't actually working after all.
